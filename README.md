# Introduction to data analytics with pandas 
### by Quentin CAUDRON

### A workshop for PyData Seattle, July 2017


This is an introductory tutorial to python library pandas by Quentin Caudron. I watched the tutorial on YouTube and applied the steps given. It is a great tutorial to practice pandas with a real data. This dataset includes the information about how much coffee was consumed, the dates the information were entered, and who entered the information. For more information, visit QCaudron.


I made two changes in the Jupyter notebook because I got an error on two codes. I specified where I made changes in my updated notebook. Look at the cells that says "Change" with a red color.
